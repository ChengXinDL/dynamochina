##  Dynamo plug-IN for robot structural analysis



###  Overview

#### Introduction 


### Overview


Dynamo Plug-in for Robot Structural Analysis is a free* technology preview that allows designers and engineers to drive Autodesk® Robot™ Structural Analysis software (or Autodesk React Structures) from Dynamo. Dynamo Plug-in for Robot Structural Analysis helps designers to create parametric and complex structural frames models in Dynamo, submit it to Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis (or Autodesk React Structures) for simulation, and review the results returned from the analysis.


**Features**

1. **Create nodes and bars in Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis**
1. **Assign cross section and material to bars**
1. **Define nodes as support**
1. **Define surfaces as shell elements**
1. **Define nodal, member, and surface loads**
1. **Run calculations on the Dynamo model**
1. **Get internal forces, displacement, and stress for bars**
1. **Get reaction for support nodes**





Participation

##Availability

This project will be available until February 28, 2016.

 

* Free technology previews are subject to the terms and conditions of the end-user license and services agreement that accompanies download of the software.



### REQUIREMENTS

Here's what you need to participate in the technology preview:
React Structures technical preview or Robot Structural Analysis 2016 (commercial or free trial)
Dynamo 0.9.0 (free)
Structural Analysis for Dynamo package (free)



### KNOWN ISSUES

* This version is the first version of the package and some issues are known:

* When closing a dynamo file, not all objects are disposed properly. To clean them, you need to close DynamoSandBox application and restart it.

* There is no message push back to Dynamo to explain why calculations have failed. You need to be sure that the model is valid for calculations. To do this, you could run calculations from Robot using the regular calculate command to get some hints.

* The Structural Analysis for Dynamo package is using currently a Dynamo 0.7.4 daily build. This package will be updated when the new version 0.7.4 will be published.



###  RELEASED BUILD 0.8.0

Based on your feedback, here's what's new in this version:

* Support for Dynamo API changes
* Added icons consistent with new Dynamo visual design
* Add new nodes to assign attributes to element by list to improve performance
* Fixed minor bugs
* Extended technology preview to July 31, 2015

Downloads - Dynamo 0.9.0
